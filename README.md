Railway station codes

The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with Q, X or Z, except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then.
